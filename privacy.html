    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your
            Personal Data with your national data protection regulator (GDPR) or applicable state regulator (under
            CCPA). However, we hope you will contact ReportSee first (support@reportsee.com) so ReportSee can try to
            address your complaint directly.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT: If you want to lodge a complaint with ReportSee, please
            direct your communication to support@reportsee.com.</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have given your consent to anything we do with your Personal Data, you have
            the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This includes your right to withdraw consent to us using

    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT: If you want ReportSee to withdraw your consent to process

    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We cannot deny goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide a
            different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your rights under the CCPA.
            &nbsp;However, if you refuse to provide your Personal Data to us or exercise one of your rights, for
            example, to delete or stop selling your Personal Data, and that Personal Data or sale is necessary for us to
            provide you with services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">You may report any claim that we have engaged in discrimination against you to an
            applicable regulator, though we would prefer that you first contact us support@reportsee.com so that we may

    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">First, to the extent Data Privacy Laws requires us to take an action without charging
            you, we will comply with those legal requirements. &nbsp;In some cases we may be permitted to charge for
            some of these services. &nbsp;We usually act on requests and provide Personal Data free of charge, but in
            such cases we may charge a reasonable fee to cover our administrative costs of providing the Personal Data,
            which such costs can arise in one or more of the following cases, which are not meant to be limited but
            merely existence:</span></p>
    <ul class="c21 lst-kix_list_3-0 start">
        <li class="c9 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Baseless or excessive/repeated requests, or</span></li>

    </ul>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alternatively, we also may be entitled to refuse to act on the request. &nbsp;Please
            consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We will respond as soon as we can. Generally, this
            will be within one month from when we receive your request but, if the request is going to take longer to
            deal with, we will come back to you and let you know.</span></p>

            information as described above or to comply with our legal obligations and legitimate interests. Please be
            advised that this means that we may retain some of your Personal Data after you cease to use our Services.
            For instance, we may retain your data as necessary to meet our legal obligations, such as for tax and
            accounting purposes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When determining the relevant period in which we retain or establish/revise periods
            for retaining Personal Data, we will take the following factors into account:</span></p>
